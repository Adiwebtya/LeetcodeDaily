Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! 🚀
This repo is a collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, written with clean, readable, and well-structured code.

📌 About

Problems are categorized by topic (Arrays, Strings, DP, Graphs, etc.) and difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Each solution includes:

✅ Problem statement (short description)

✅ My approach / explanation

✅ Code implementation (C++ / Python / Java, depending on problem)

Goal: Consistent practice to strengthen problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms.
